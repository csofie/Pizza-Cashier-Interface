# Pizza-Cashier-Interface
Here is the code to my first place WLN Hackathon 2023 project - 
Pizza Cashier Interface!

Note -
This is my attempt at a database project, and I focused more on functions over design. The code could be cleaner, and I plan to clean it up a bit more in the future.

I plan to update the design of the information to look something like this in the future.

Here is a link to the demo!

Make sure to set up the Java MySQL connector and import the preset .sql database into MySQL Databench.
I used NetBean's preset swing designer. All function was programmed by myself. 


Enjoy, and 
Thank you! :)
